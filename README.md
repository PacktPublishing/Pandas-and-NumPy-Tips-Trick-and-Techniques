## About the Video Course
This course will empower you with new possibilities using NumPy and pandas that you probably never knew existed, and tips to use them to increase your efficiency and productivity in your daily tasks. Each section will cover key tips, tricks, and techniques for efficient data analysis in NumPy and pandas that you can apply in your own real-world scenarios to increase your output and efficiency. You’ll learn how to make your data more meaningful and contextual by adding customization. We’ll also cover the new features introduced in NumPy and pandas and leverage them to simplify the way you use them for your data science requirements. By the end of this course, you will be able to get the best out of your code much faster and and more efficiently.
